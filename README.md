A fully original pixel UI element created with a restricted color palette. This dialog box was designed to reflect Mikaâ€™s mood, tone, and story. Sprite expressions, button layout, and text clarity were carefully crafted for player immersion.

A pixel animation showcasing Mikaâ€™s idle and walking cycles. Each frame was carefully crafted at 64Ã—64 pixels to reflect the flow of her robe, sway of her hood charm, and subtle head and arm movementâ€”capturing her personality in motion.
